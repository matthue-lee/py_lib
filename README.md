# py_lib
An open-source Python library for programming with real- time sensor data. 



BACKGROUND 
Input to programs created using Python typically happen using keyboard and mouse. The ability to incorporate real-time
environmental data measured through sensors as input could open doors to new programming experiences.

With this in mind, we developed a toolkit consisting of six plug-and-play USB sensors that measure various physical
phenomena such as humidity, temperature, conductance, air quality, light and heart rate.



PROJECT DESCRIPTION
The goal of this project is to develop a python library that services all sensor communications to allow users to easily program
with their data.

Basic functions that the library should handle include establishing stable sensor connectivity, decoding live sensor data and
providing appropriate methods for working with this data.

Users can then use this sensor data in tasks like visualizations (e.g. Matplotlib), creating data models for investigations (e.g.
sci-kit) or developing games that react to changes in the environment (e.g. pygame).



AVAILABLE RESOURCES
All sensor hardware and documentation on accessing sensor data.
